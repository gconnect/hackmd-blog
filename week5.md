# EPF5 Dev Updates - Week 5
This week I practiced running of node. Specifically running Geth execution client and Prysm consenus beacon node client.

It was a great experience seeing the different client run side by side but it took a while for the execution client to sync with the Prysm beacon client.

I was able to run the client on both Mainnet, Sepolia and Holesky Tesnet.



## Summary of What I did this week
- Attended standup
- Watched some of the sessions from EthCC 2024
- Practice running of Ethereum node
- Spent some time going through Ephemery Testnet repository
- Started working on a draft proposal for Ephemery Tesnet project
- Created a youtube tutorial on how to run a node


## What I will do next week
- Complete the draft proposal
- Get ready for project presentation
- Try adding Ephemery Testnet to any of the client. i.e Geth and Lighthouse or Prysm and further practice on interacting with the client on Ephemery Tesnt


## Blockers 

- I had some challenge adding Ephemery Testnet to the Geth and Prysm client
