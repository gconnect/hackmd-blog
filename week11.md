# EPF5 Dev Updates - Week 11

## What I did this week
I participated in weekly standup and Office hour. This week office hour we had the priviledge of having an AMA session with lightclient who shared his core protocol development journey and how he came up with his name which was quite interesting.

Key takeaways for me from his session was persistence and always show up. This was a key part of what got him into working full time with the Geth team. After some number of years of just been an outside contributor.

The PR I made last week, received quite a number of comments from mcfaria from the Besu team, which I spent most of the week working on.

-  Created a new java file and class for the Genesis generation. 
-  Created a new Test file with good number of unit test using Junit and Mockito. To check for various scenarios.
-  Here is a link to the [Ephemery Implementation on Besu client PR](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/7471/).


## What I will do next week
- Follow up on the PR for any requested updates
- Commence work on the Teku client


## Blockers 

- None at the moment!
