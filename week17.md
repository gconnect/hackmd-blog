I participated in weekly standup and Office hour. This week's [office hour guest](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-five/issues/472).

This week, I continued working on the database reset feature on the Teku client. 

And further updated my Besu PR. Below are the details and links to PRs of each of the work done;

## Besu Client Implementation
I made some changes to the PR, fixed some failing test and update some of the variable names and the PR was finally merged this week.

Here is a link to the [merged Ephemery Native support PR](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/7563/) on Besu.

I created an issue to [add the database reset](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/7736) feature on Besu.

## Teku Client Implementation
I continued working on the Ephemery reset feature on the Teku client.

I have an ongoing [PR to check the network on start and reset the db](https://github.com/Consensys/teku/pull/8642/).


## Ephemery Repo
I updated the Ephemery repo with the current client implementation changes. Here is a link to the [PR](https://github.com/ephemery-testnet/ephemery-resources/pull/12)
