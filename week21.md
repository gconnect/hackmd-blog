# EPF5 Dev Updates - Week 21

## What I did this week
As the cohort 5 fellowship draws to a close. This will be my last weekly update. And this week participated in the weekly standup to give update on the progress I have made so far. 

This week office hour was dedicated to those that won't be able to make it to Devcon to do their presentation. But very few fellows signed up for it. So it was moved to next and final week of the fellowship.


## Teku Client Implementation

This [PR to validate the slot on Ephemery and throw the appropriate exception](https://github.com/Consensys/teku/pull/8759), got merged. With this merged PR the reset feature on Teku is now completed.

## Teku Documentation
I added documentation to the Teku documentation to reflect the Ephemery implementation work done on Teku. This will help users know that they have the option to run Ephemery network. And here is the [PR to Add documentation for Ephemery](https://github.com/Consensys/doc.teku/pull/621).


## Besu Documentation
I also added documentation content to the Besu documentation to reflect the Ephemery work done on Besu. This will help users easily know what to do when they need to run Ephemery network. Here is a link to the [PR to Add documentation for Ephemery](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu-docs/pull/1727).

## Ephemery Repo
I updated the client implementation file in the Ephemery repo to reflect the current state of implementation and documentation work done on both Besu and Teku client pairs. Here is a link to the [opened PR to update the client implementation status for Besu and Teku](https://github.com/ephemery-testnet/ephemery-resources/pull/15)

## Ethereum Website
The minor fix I made on the official Ethereum website a couple of weeks ago was also merged some weeks back. Here is a link to the [merged PR to fix issues with table format](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/pull/13870)


## What I will do next week
- Follow up on the documentation PR on Besu
- Follow up on the documentation PR on Teku
- Follow up on my client implementation update PR on the Ephemery repo
- Finish up my presentation
